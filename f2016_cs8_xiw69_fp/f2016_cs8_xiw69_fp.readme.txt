I adapted the code from my assignment 3, added the participants class as required.
And in the participants class, I added those methods as required in the final project PDF.
To provide convenience, I added getRuns() method which returns the 'self.runs' to get the
total participate times from each participant. I also changed some data structures for the
OOP design. For instance, my 'participantsAndDistance' variable was a dictionary with
keys of participants' names and values of a list (first index is total distance; second index
is individual runs). After the modification for final project, the values in 'participantsAndDistance'
variable are now instances of participants object, and I can use those public methods in
participants class to set and get the data I need in this project.
